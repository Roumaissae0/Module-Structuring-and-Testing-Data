// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made

//     Line 4, 5, 8, 10 . I got Number and replaceAll in line 4, the same thing in line 5 , PercentageChange in line 8 and console.log 

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?

//     The error is SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list. The way that we can fix it is adding a , to replaceall in line 5 is different from the line 4

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements

//     The line 4 and 5

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations

//     The line 1, 2, 7 and 8

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?

//     It remove the , from the number so it will be a real number and not just text with a comma.
